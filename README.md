 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a Guy.

     Being a Guy includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

       1a. Modify the original work adding useless code, or inlines, to make it hard to reverse -
       although knowing it will be reversed anyway - wasting time on both sides, that's REALLY being a Guy.
   
       1b. As a developer, you should care (about your work and users). 
       Ignoring it by simply reply "I don't care" would make you a PROPER Guy.

 2. If your user have some opinions about your work, at lease take a look. 
 Only a RUDE Guy would reply with "Who cares" without mind in brain.

 3. When you make some API related projects, make sure your users could have reasonable quota.
 By giving your users some 100 requests per day calling it "limited API" would make you an MISERLY Guy.

 3. Commercial use is allowed - but make sure you have reasonable price. $30 for 510 credits and $68 for 1020 credits
 makes you a CRIME-COMMITING Guy. Remember that pricing style is considered illegal in many countries.

 4. Code is provided with no warranty. However sometimes, you should go fix some security.
 When you want security, do it yourself before claming "We have upgraded security".
 Half-verify user requests allowing someone to upload unreasonble values like `1.7976931348623157e+308`
 would make you a DONKEY Guy.
 
 5. Never play joke on your teammate. Simply consider someone's work as 'bad' would make you
 a IMPOLITE Guy. Do it your self instead of talking it.
 
 6. User who paid a lot, test and provide you security infos are your friends. 
 Banning their accounts by some TOC shit would make you a DICKY Guy.

 7. Respect your top-players (and those who paid a lot!). Banning their accounts only based on
 some gossips, that's really make you a BASTARD Guy.
